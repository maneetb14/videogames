    Why do people enjoy Pac-Man?
      <p>There is no doubt that Pac-Man has changed video gaming forever. Many videogame companys 
    base thier games on the way Pac-Man is programmed.
   <p> PacMan is fun because unlike other video games, 
    the goal of this game is not to shoot/destroy the other objects/opponents
    but trying to stay clear of their way. </p>
    <p>Many people find this interesting because although many games involve violance, this game does not include. This is also a game of 
    strategy and focus which helps strengthen the brain and improve muscle memory. </p>
    There are also many games simialr to Pac-Man that people who play it would enjoy such as minesweeper, 
    breakout, tetris, slither.io, mario bros and many more.
