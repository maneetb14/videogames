      <p>Pac-Man has become very popular over the past few decades and has been sold on many 
      different platforms such as on mobile, through mostly every gaming console and also as an 
      arcade game. </p>
      
      <p>Since the original game came out there have been many remakes and sequels. 
      Of those remakes some of them were unofficially in the Pac-Man game series because they 
      weren't published by <b> Namco</b> (the company that released the original pacman), but  some of
       them actually belong in the pacman series such as<b> Pac-Man plus, Super Pac-Man, Pac Mania, 
       Pac-Man Battle Royale </b>and many more which are also available for purchase. </p>

       <p>Pac-man plus was released on March 13th, 1982 and is the third game in the Pac-Man game 
       series. Super Pac-Man is the fourth game in the Pac-Man series and was released in Japan 
       on August 11th 1982 and in North America on October 1st 1982. Pac Mania was released by 
       Namco on June 14th 1987 and is the ninth game in the Pac-Man series. Lastly Pac-Man battle
       royal was the seventeenth game in the series and was released in the arcade on January of 2011 
       and was later released in the Pac-Man museum for digital release in 2014.</p>
